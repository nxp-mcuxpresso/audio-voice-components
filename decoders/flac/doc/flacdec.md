| Track type | Duration of track in second |  Performance MIPS of codec (in MHz) |
|:----------:|:---------------------------:|------------------------------------:|
|48 kHz, stereo| 76 s | 30.7 MHz  |
|32 kHz, stereo| 76 s | 20.3 MHz  |
|8 kHz, stereo| 37 s | 5.34 MHz |

### Following test cases are performed:
* Audio format listening test
* Audio quality test

For all above test cases, test tracks are played through the end without any distortion, glitching, hanging, or crashing.
