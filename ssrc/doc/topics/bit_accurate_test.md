# Bit accurate test

The TestFiles directory of the release package contains a test input \(sampled at 44,100 Hz\) and several expected output files \(sample rates from 8000 Hz to 48,000 Hz\). If the same test input file is applied to the SRC after integration in the target platform, the output is bit accurate with the expected output file that matches the output-sample rate
